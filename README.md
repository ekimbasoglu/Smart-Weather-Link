# Smart-Weather-Link

IoT project works with Arduino Uno, reciving the data with NodeJs through sockets, displaying on Angular!

## Which sensors are used?

```
    FC-37 Rain Sensor
    Soil Moisture Sensor
    DHT-11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor
    SG90 RC Mini (9gr) Servo
```

## How to run it?

For API(Nodejs):

```
    (for installing the packages) => $ npm install
    $ cd api && node server.js
```

For UI(Angular):

```
    (for installing the packages) => $ npm install
    $ cd angular && ng serve
```

How to upload Arduino Uno Code:

```
    (for installing the IDE) => $ brew install --cask arduino-ide
    Open the File
    Install library for DHT
    Choose board and port => Arduino Uno/ and the usb port arduino connected
    Upload(âŒ˜U)
```
