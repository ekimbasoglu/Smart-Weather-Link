## TO-DO
For now it makes transaction with server.js, just writing
I uploaded necesarry arduino code to the device, so;

### [server.js] - needs to read what are the outputs

### [server.js] - it needs to send those outputs through open PORT; so FE can read

### [update on arduino] - it needs to make those transaction based on bluetooth

### [FE] - FE needs to fetch those data through Node.js
### [FE] - If the plant is dry based on sensor, there must be button which as option so user can interract with additional sensor
### [FE] - [BE] - Communication must be instant, maybe with Socket is required.


## Expected Serial communication;


Humidity on Air (%): 49.00
Temperature (°C): 26.60
Soil is dry
